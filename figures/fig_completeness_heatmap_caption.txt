Figure X. Data completeness heatmap showing the percentage of non-null values for each original data column across the three dataset files. Green indicates complete or near-complete data (≥90%), yellow indicates partial completeness (50–89%), and red indicates significant gaps (<50%). Only original data columns are shown; derived variables (e.g., Country_clean, Method_clean, Continent) created during standardization are excluded as they are 100% complete by construction. The 'Study region' column in 02_Classification shows 38% completeness, reflecting that many papers do not explicitly specify a geographic study area. Columns such as 'Notes' and 'Sub_state' have intentionally low completeness as they are optional fields. The WV_min, WV_median, and WV_max columns in 03_WaterValue show 0% completeness as the unit conversion pipeline is pending completion by a collaborator.
